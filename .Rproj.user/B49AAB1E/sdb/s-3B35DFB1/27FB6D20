The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc.\n\n```{r}\navgTable <- ddply(clean, .(interval, date), summarize, Avg = mean(steps))\nnadata <- activity[is.na(activity$steps),]\nnewdata <- merge(nadata, activity, by=\"interval\", \"date\")\n```\nCreate a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.\n```{r}\nactivity2 <- subset(activity, !is.na(activity$steps))\ndAta <- activity\nimPact <- is.na(dAta$steps)\ntAvg <- tapply(activity2$steps, activity2$interval, mean, na.rm = TRUE, simplify = T)\ndAta$steps[imPact] <- tAvg[as.character(dAta$interval[imPact])]\n```\nMake a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day. Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment? What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?\n\n```{r]}\ntotalStepsperday2 <- aggregate(steps ~ date, dAta, FUN = sum)\npar(mar = c(5,8,3,1))\n\nhist(totalStepsperday2$steps, breaks = 10, col = \"pink\", xlab = \"Daily Steps\", main = \"Total Steps In A Day\")\nhist(totalStepsdays$steps, breaks = 10, col = \"red\", xlab = \"Daily Steps\", main = \"Total Steps In A Day\", add=T) \nlegend(\"topleft\", c(\"Imputed\", \"NA\"), fill = c(\"pink\",\"red\"))\n```\nMean and median totals.\n```{r}\nmean(totalStepsdays$steps)\nmean(totalStepsperday2$steps)\nmedian(totalStepsdays$steps)\nmedian(totalStepsperday2$steps)\n```\nThe mean remains the same, but the median is slightly increased.\n\nQ4: Are there differences in activity patterns between weekday and weekends?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCreate a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels – “weekday” and “weekend” indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.\n\n```{r}\ndAta$DayCategory <- ifelse(dAta$day %in% c(\"Saturday\", \"Sunday\"), \"Weekend\", \"Weekday\")\n```\nMake a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. type = \"l\") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis). See the README file in the GitHub repository to see an example of what this plot should look like using simulated data.\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(lattice)\nintervalTable2 <- ddply(dAta, .(interval, DayCategory), summarize, Avg = mean(steps))\nxyplot(interval ~ steps|DayCategory, data=dAta, type=\"l\",  layout = c(1,2),\n       main=\"Average Steps per Interval Based on Type of Day\", \n       ylab=\"Average Number of Steps\", xlab=\"Interval\")\n```\n",
